This is Michael O'Connor's "fork" of John Harrison's code accompanying his book 
"Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning".  The license is the same 
as before, see LICENSE.TXT.

It has my personalizations. Right now, the changes are: running "make top" will
construct a proper custom toplevel with the appropriate libraries, and those 
libraries no longer have any side-effects when you link them in.
